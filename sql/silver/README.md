Silver SQL layer



This layer contains cleaned and normalized wallet level datasets derived from bronze queries.



Silver queries standardize timestamps, wallet identifiers, and event types to enable reliable aggregation and cohort analysis.



Typical silver outputs

\- Wallet first seen timestamps

\- Daily wallet activity by feature

\- Normalized wallet event tables



These tables act as the foundation for gold level metrics.
