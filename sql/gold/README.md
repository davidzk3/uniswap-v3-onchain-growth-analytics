Gold SQL layer



This layer contains aggregated and analysis ready queries used directly in dashboards.



Gold queries answer specific product and growth questions and are optimized for interpretability rather than completeness.



Typical gold queries

\- Feature adoption over time

\- Wallet feature mix over rolling windows

\- Swap to LP conversion metrics

\- Retention by feature segment

\- Week 1 retention snapshot



All gold queries in V1 use a rolling 30 day window and short horizon weekly cohorts.
