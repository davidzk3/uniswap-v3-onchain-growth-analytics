Silver layer



The silver layer contains cleaned wallet level behavioral tables derived from bronze inputs.



At this stage, raw events are normalized into consistent schemas suitable for analysis.



Examples of silver level concepts



Wallet first seen

First observed interaction for a wallet across swaps or LP activity.



Wallet activity by day

Daily wallet activity tagged by feature type.



Wallet events

Normalized swap and LP events with consistent wallet and timestamp fields.



Purpose

The silver layer enables reliable aggregation and segmentation without repeatedly reprocessing raw protocol data.
